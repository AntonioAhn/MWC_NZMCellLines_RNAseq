# Information on the PDL1 cell lines 

There are 23 melanoma cell lines that were analysed using RNA-seq and characterised for PD-L1 protein levels using FACs. 


# Flow cytometry information 

The antibody used for PD-L1 staining for flow cytometry consists of 
PE anti-human CD274/PD-L1 (Biolegend, catalog# 329706) and the isotype control antibody (PE Mouse IgG2b, Biolegend, catalog#:400314). 

The PD-L1 expression levels of melanoma cell lines was determined using BD FACS CantoII.
All analyses were performed using the Kaluza (Beckman Coulter, version 2.0) software.
Approximately 10,000 events/cells were measured for each sample. The flow cytometry gating
was used to exclude dead cells and doublet cells. The median fluorescence intensity (MFI) for
the isotype control and anti-PDL1 was obtained. The MFI for PD-L1 staining was normalised for
background absorbance by subtracting out the isotype fluorescence value.


# RNA-seq information 






The cell lines regarding the PD-L1 were part of Antonio Ahns PhD project. 

RNA-seq was performed.
